# Oyster

Oyster is a Swift-programmed iOS application that generates spontaneous travel itineraries, and was built at PennApps XIV. 
Team members: Linda Xia, Raunak Gupta, Stephen He. 
Tools used: Swift 2, Sketch 3, Foursquare API, Apple Mapkit and Lyft API. 
We recently received a grant from the 1517 Fund, a venture capitalist fund for young founders, to continue development on this project.
